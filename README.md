## What is FairShare?

FairShare is a simple but useful application which can help you and your community to manage the expenses.

Often, when you spend some quality time with your friends or family, only one person will go to the shop instead of everyone, and purchase the required ingredients for the dinner (or the 10 trays of beer for the night).
If it happens, it's always a torture to calculate who owes whom and how much money. It would be great to have another option, right?

Good news! There is! Or there will be... maybe.

With FairShare, you can

+ create virtual receipts;
+ add your friends to the receipts (and also to items within them);
+ keep tracking your expenses and debits;
+ relax, and not to worry about getting your money back.

## About branching

The project uses two separate branches:

+ __dev__: development branch
+ __master__: release branch (always stable)
,
We merge to the master branch often, with pull requests to make sure everybody approves the release.
